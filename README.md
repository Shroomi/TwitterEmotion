# Twitter Emotion Analysis
## Introduction of Data
* dev-gold.csv is a file of standard emotion label
* dev-predicted.csv is a file of predicted emotion label
* dev.csv is a file of twitter data with emotion label
* train.csv is a file of twitter data without emotion label
## First step(_evaluation.py_)
* I use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure to evaluate the predicted result
* Change the evaluation from evaluation.py to EvaluationOOP.py with object oriented programming
